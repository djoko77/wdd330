                            <li>The legacy DOM had a useful property called document.forms that returns an HTML collection of all the forms</li>
                            <li>A form object also has a method called elements that returns an HTML collection of all the elements contained in the form</li>
                            <li>We can also access the form controls using their "name" attributes</li>
                            <li>The form.reset() method will reset all the form controls back to their initial values</li>
                            <li>A button with a type attribute of reset can also be used to reset the form</li>
                            <li>The form.action property can be used to set the action attribute of a form</li>
                            <li>Stop the form from being submitted to the URL altogether by using the preventDefault() method</li>
                            <li>In select, the "selected" attribute can be used to set the initial value in the HTML</li>
                            <li>Form validation is the process of checking whether a user has entered the information into a form correctly</li>
                            <li>If the submit button is disabled (disabled property) then no action is taken when it's clicked</li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul class="subnotes">
                            <li>OOP â€“ encapsulation, polymorphism, inheritance</li>
                            <li>The parentheses are not required when instantiating a new object using a constructor function</li>
                            <li>The static keyword can be used in class declarations to create a static method</li>
                            <li>Static methods are not available to instances of the class</li>
                            <li>All classes and constructor functions have a prototype property that returns an object</li>
                            <li>Never use arrays or objects as a default value in prototype</li>
                            <li>All objects ultimately inherit from the prototype of the Object() constructor function</li>
                            <li>A class can inherit from another class using the extends keyword in a class declaration</li>
                            <li>The keyword "super" refers to the parent class, and can be used to access any properties and call any methods of the parent class</li>
                            <li>Polymorphism means that different objects can have the same method, but implement it in different ways</li>
                            <li>Instead of using assignment, we can add properties to an object using the Object.defineProperty()</li>
                            <li>A mixin is a way of adding properties and methods of some objects to another object without using inheritance</li>
                            <li>Array.from() method can be used to turn an array-like object into an array</li>
                            <li>Keep inheritance chains short in creating classs</li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul class="subnotes">
                            <li>A JavaScript library is a piece of code that provides several methods that make it easier to achieve common tasks</li>
                            <li>A big advantage of using jQuery is its support for older browsers like Internet Explorer.</li>
                            <li>Lodash can be thought of as a superset of Underscore as it does everything Underscore does</li>
                            <li>A module is a self-contained piece of code that provides functions and methods that can then be used in other files and by other module</li>
                            <li>A module has its own global scope, so any variables created in the top-level of a module can only be accessed within that module.</li>
                            <li>MVC separates an application into three distinct, independent components that interact with each other: model, view, and controllers</li>
                            <li>React and Vue.js both use the concept of a virtual DOM to speed up the process of updating HTML pages</li>
                            <li>It is usually best to just install the latest version of a package</li>
                            <li>Minification is the process of removing any unnecessary characters from your code to reduce the file size</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>The Person class should have a method called describe which returns a string with the following syntax: "name, age years old". So for example, if John is 19 years old then the function describe of his object will return "John, 19 years old"</p>
