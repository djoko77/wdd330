                        <h3>Chapter 11: Further Functions</h3>
                        <ul class="subnotes">
                            <li>Functions are first-class objects: they can be passed around</li>
                            <li>Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE)– is an anonymous function which is invoked as soon as it’s defined</li>
                            <li>IFFE is achieved by placing parentheses at the end of the function definition</li>
                            <li>temp variable only exists while the IIFE is invoked: const temp = a;</li>
                            <li>Lazy Definition Pattern is often used when some initialization code is required the first time it’s invoked</li>
                            <li>Recursive function invokes itself until a certain condition is met</li>
                            <li>Callback function is passed to other functions as arguments and then invoked inside the function they are passed to</li>
                            <li>JavaScript event-loop does not block the rest of the program from running</li>
                            <li>Callback hell is the term used to refer to this tangled mess of code</li>
                            <li>A promise represents the future result of an asynchronous operation</li>
                            <li>Resolved ― the asynchronous operation was completed successfully</li>
                            <li>Rejected ― the asynchronous operation didn’t work as expected, wasn't successfully completed or resulted in an error</li>
                            <li>If each function that performs an asynchronous operation returns a promise, we can chain the then() methods together to form a sequential piece of code</li>
                            <li>Async functions allow you to write asynchronous code as if it was synchronous by using the await operator before an asynchronous function</li>
                            <li>The await operator will ensure the next line of code is not executed</li>
                            <li>A closure is a reference to a variable that was created inside the scope of another function</li>
                            <li>In using a pure function, the return value of a pure function should only depend on the values provided as arguments, no side-effect, and allows referential transparency.</li>
                            <li>Higher-order functions are functions that accept another function as an argument, or return another function as a result, or both</li>
                            <li>Currying is a process that involves the partial application of functions. A function is said to be curried when not all arguments have been supplied to the function.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li>Ajax is a technique that allows web pages to communicate asynchronously with a server, and it dynamically updates web pages without reloading</li>
                            <li>Application programming interface (API) is a collection of methods that allows external access to another program or service.</li>
                            <li>The Fetch API provides a global fetch() method that only has one mandatory argument, which is the URL of the resource you wish to fetch</li>
                            <li>The text() method takes a stream of text from the response, reads it to completion and then returns a promise that resolves to a USVSting object that can be treated as a string in JavaScript.</li>
                            <li>The json() method is used to deal with these by transforming a stream of JSON data into a promise that resolves to a JavaScript object</li>
                            <li>The Fetch API includes the FormData interface, which makes it much easier to submit information in forms using Ajax.</li>
